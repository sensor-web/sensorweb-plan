# Long-term Goals for SensorWeb(draft)
Our long-term goal is to create an *open data platform for IoT* for engineers/scientists to solve real world problems and deliver value to people.

## How to Get There
We have three steps to get our long-term goal.

1. Make successful data project(s) by ourself.
2. Third-party groups make successful data projects(s).
3. Create SensorWeb ecosystem.

### Our Projects
#### Purpose
Make people feel and experience the value of IoT product. That will help IoT generation come faster, and let's move it forward.

### Third-party Projects
#### Purpose
Build our platform features.

### Ecosystem
#### Purpose
Build our branding. Make engineers/scientists understand it's timing to start to create IoT products and let them want to and can do that.
